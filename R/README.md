# R Code Structure – STA 6222

R scripts are organised by teaching week:

- `week01_intro/` – introductory examples and simple deterministic models
- `week02_sir/`   – SIR model simulations and parameter exploration
- `week03_seir/`  – SEIR model simulations and latency-focused scenarios

Within each folder, use descriptive filenames, e.g.:

- `sir_basic_sim.R`
- `seir_vary_sigma.R`
