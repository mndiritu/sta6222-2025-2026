# STA 6222 – Models for Disease Transmission and Management
## 2025–2026 – R/Python Simulations

This repository hosts R and Python code used in the MSc Statistics (Medical Statistics Option)
course STA 6222 at the University of Nairobi (2025–2026 academic year).

### Structure

- `R/` – R scripts and RMarkdown files for simulations and demonstrations
- `python/` – Python scripts and notebooks
- `data/` – small example datasets for teaching (no identifiable data)
- `notes/` – helper notes, snippets and supporting material

The aim is to provide reproducible, well-documented examples that connect mathematical
models of disease transmission (SIR, SEIR, stochastic variants, etc.) with practical
computational implementation.
