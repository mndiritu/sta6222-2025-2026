- Use clear, descriptive filenames (e.g. `week3_seir_sim.R`, `week4_R0_nextgen.py`).
- Include a short header comment in each script explaining:
  - which week/lecture it belongs to,
  - what model it implements.
- Avoid committing large or sensitive datasets.
- Use `main` for teaching-ready material. Experimental work can go to feature branches.
